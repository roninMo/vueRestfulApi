I had some user stories and work to finish last week for a freelancing project, and thought I'd get up to speed. This goes through crud functionality, vue's directives, routing, emit handler functions, and overall understanding of Vue's structure along with responsive design. I used axios to daisy chain promise functions from api calls, and I really like the flow of Vue. The way it handles props and state remind me a lot of React, and it's got a similar structure to Angular, but it's really robust and intuitive. It's got a nice design with restful api functionality across multiple different api's. I was already familiar with them, and was just building for fun. It wouldn't be hard to connect it to one of my back ends and create authentication and everything along with it! You have full crud functionality on the jsonplaceholder api, search functionality on the rick and morty api, and studio ghibli was just for fun (I love studio ghibli!). I understand how to create the sql queries on the back end to create these searches via routing myself, I just thought this would be nice to put together for you.
