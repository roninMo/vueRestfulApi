        <h2>Restful Vue API with Vuetify library</h2>

          Check out my portfolio! I've done a lot of these in sprints, so none
          of them are full on sites like your products, but show I understand
          the fundamentals and core concepts for each stack/language used.

          I really don't mind doing front or backend work, I really like
          creating MVC's and routing though so I'm more of a back end dev. When
          I build in front end I'll use whatever library or theme pack the
          project or client demands. Whether that's building unique design or
          augmenting some stuff that's already put together I enjoy putting it
          together. From connecting to restful api's or backend, to building
          authentication I've got a solid understanding and I'm happy to help
          with whatever task is thrown my way.

          So I heard about this job last week, and I'm just doing freelancing
          work right now actively searching for a job, and have a lot of
          experience in Javascript frameworks such as Angular and React. I had
          some user stories and work to finish last week, but I thought I'd get
          up to speed by learning Vue fundamentals and put a simple front end
          site together that goes through crud functionality, vue's directives,
          routing, emit handler functions, and overall understanding of Vue's .
          I used axios to daisy chain promise functions from api calls, and I
          really like the flow of Vue. The way it handles props and state remind
          me a lot of React, and it's got a similar structure to Angular, but
          it's really robust and intuitive.
